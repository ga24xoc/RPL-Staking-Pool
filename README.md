# RPL-Staking-Pool

A RPL Staking Pool is pool for users to stake RPL and get yield in return.

# Introduction

Rocketpool is staking platform within the Ethereum ecosystem. Its token is RPL. Rocketpool matches Node Operator with user that do want to stake but not run a node on their own. Node Operator have to deposit 16 eth + an insurance in form of RPL, and get 16 eth from a pool to be able to start up a node. reth is given to user depositing in Rocketpool. reth represents their stake + staking rewards. Node Operator take a commission for doing the duty of running a machine to stake.

# Purpose of the RPL Staking Pool

Node Operator might not want to have exposure to RPL. RPL is volatile, subject to speculation, has smart contract risks, and concerns tax-wise. Trust in the value of the token is an important factor here. A RPL Staking Pool abstracts risk and trust away from the Node Operator by matching their nodes with RPL from the RPL Staking Pool.

# How does it work?

User wanting to speculate on RPL can deposit their RPL into the staking pool. Node Operator - that do not want exposure to RPL - pick the deposited RPL up and start up a node.

# How does it look like?

The RPL Staking Pool will have a simple user interface. It might look like this:
