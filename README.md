# RPL-Staking-Pool

A RPL Staking Pool is pool for users to stake RPL and get yield in return.

# Introduction

Rocketpool is a staking platform within the Ethereum ecosystem. Its token is RPL. Rocketpool matches Node Operators with Liquid Stakers in a permissionsless, trustless way. Liquid stakers provide arbitrary amounts of ETH to Rocketpool, Node Operators pick it up and stake it on their behalf. Node Operators will take a commission for doing the duty of running a node to secure the Ethereum network via staking.

Node Operators have to deposit 16 ETH + an insurance in the form of RPL.

# Purpose of the RPL Staking Pool

Node Operators might not want to have exposure to RPL. RPL is volatile, is subject to speculation, has smart contract risks, and has tax considerations. Trust in the value of the token is an important factor here. An RPL Staking Pool abstracts risk and trust away from the Node Operator by matching their nodes with RPL from the RPL Staking Pool.

# How does it work?

Users wanting to speculate on RPL can deposit their RPL into the staking pool. Node Operators - that do not want exposure to RPL - pick the deposited RPL up and start up a node.

# How does it look like?

The RPL Staking Pool will have a simple user interface. It might look like this:
